# Simple-Node-backend-for-ThePipp3-template

Backend for my [ThePipp3](https://github.com/Splitter/ThePipp3-Bootstrap-Sass-PUG-theme "ThePipp3") template. Keystone is not really best suited for this application. So the code is written in a way that makes it easy to remove and replace Keystone with a better or custom option later.
